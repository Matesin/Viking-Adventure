Yoo, welcome to this repo!
The original intention in this project was to fulfill the scope of the assignment that was given to me as a part of my Java class at uni. 
However, it turned out to be quite fun so after i was done with all my exams, I decided to try to give this project some more touches 
to make it look like a proper game.
TODO: rest of readme haha
